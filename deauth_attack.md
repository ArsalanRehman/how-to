## The Deauthentication Attack Explained

A **deauthentication attack** (often shortened to "deauth attack") is a type of denial-of-service (DoS) attack that targets Wi-Fi networks. It works by sending a flood of "deauthentication frames" to a client device, tricking it into disconnecting from the wireless network it's currently connected to. The client's device will then automatically try to reconnect, and if the attack is continuous, it will be caught in a cycle of connecting and disconnecting, preventing it from using the Wi-Fi network. The goal of this attack is to disrupt network access for a specific client or all clients connected to an access point.

## What You Need to Perform a Deauth Attack

Before you start, you'll need the following:

- A **wireless network card** that supports **monitor mode** and **packet injection**. Not all Wi-Fi cards have this capability. You can use tools like `Aircrack-ng` to check your card's compatibility.
- A **Linux-based operating system** like Kali Linux, which comes pre-installed with the necessary tools.

## Step-by-Step Guide to Performing a Deauthentication Attack

⚠️ **Disclaimer**: This guide is for educational purposes only. Unauthorized deauthentication attacks are illegal and can have serious consequences. Always ensure you have explicit permission to test on any network you are working with.

### Step 1: Put Your Wireless Card in Monitor Mode

First, you need to enable **monitor mode** on your wireless adapter. Monitor mode allows the card to "listen" to all traffic on a Wi-Fi channel, even if it's not addressed to your device. This is crucial for capturing the necessary information to perform the attack.

```bash
sudo airmon-ng start wlan0
```

- `airmon-ng` is the tool used to manage wireless cards in the **Aircrack-ng suite**.
- `start` is the command to initiate monitor mode.
- `wlan0` is the name of your wireless interface. After running this command, your interface name might change to something like `wlan0mon`.

### Step 2: Scan for Wi-Fi Networks

Next, you'll use `airodump-ng` to scan for nearby wireless networks. This command will show you a list of networks (and their associated clients) within range, along with valuable information like their BSSID, channel, and signal strength.

```bash
sudo airodump-ng wlan0mon
```

- `airodump-ng` is used to capture packets and display network information.
- `wlan0mon` is the new name of your wireless interface in monitor mode.

### Step 3: Target a Specific Network and Client

Once you have identified your target network from the list, you need to gather more specific information about it, including its channel and the MAC addresses of any connected clients.

```bash
sudo airodump-ng --channel [channel of router] --bssid [MAC address of router] wlan0mon
```

- `--channel [channel of router]` restricts the scan to a specific channel. This significantly improves efficiency and data capture.
- `--bssid [MAC address of router]` focuses the scan on the MAC address of the access point (the router).

This will give you a detailed view of the target network and its connected clients. Look for the MAC addresses of the clients you want to target in the "STATION" column.

### Step 4: Perform the Deauthentication Attack

Finally, you can execute the deauthentication attack using the `aireplay-ng` tool.

```bash
sudo aireplay-ng --deauth 0 -a [access point MAC] -c [client MAC] wlan0mon
```

- `--deauth 0` specifies the type of attack. The `0` sends an infinite number of deauthentication packets, ensuring a continuous attack. You can change this number to a specific count (e.g., `--deauth 100` to send 100 packets).
- `-a [access point MAC]` specifies the MAC address of the target access point.
- `-c [client MAC]` specifies the MAC address of the client you want to deauthenticate. If you omit this part, the command will deauthenticate all clients connected to the access point.
- `wlan0mon` is the monitor mode interface.

After running this command, the target client will be forcibly disconnected from the network.

## How to Protect Against Deauth Attacks

Protecting against deauthentication attacks is difficult at the client level because the attack exploits a fundamental weakness in the Wi-Fi protocol. However, there are some measures that can help:

- **Implement WPA3**: The WPA3 security protocol includes **management frame protection (MFP)**, which is designed to prevent these types of attacks by encrypting or signing management frames like deauthentication requests. This makes it much harder for an attacker to forge them.
- **Use a VPN**: While a VPN won't stop the attack itself, it will ensure that even if you are disconnected from the network, your data remains encrypted and your online activities are not exposed.
- **Be Aware of Your Surroundings**: Practice good digital hygiene and be cautious when connecting to public or unsecured Wi-Fi networks.
